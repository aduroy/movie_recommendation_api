# Movie Recommendation API

This project aims at providing a simple API for movie recommendation, based on:

> MovieLens 20M Dataset

=> [download](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

Please save CSV files into the `data/` folder.

The pre-trained model for 20M ratings is downloadable [here](https://we.tl/t-s2o6YaPDgV) and must be placed in `data/model/`.

## Approach

To achieve the task, the following steps are:

    [1] Explore the dataset
    [2] Build a recommender system for any user in the dataset
    [3] Build a similarity measure between movies
    [4] Measure results

[1] Dataset exploration can be found at:

```bash
- results/output_explore_dataset_movies.txt
- results/output_explore_dataset_ratings.txt
```

which are basically outputs of, respectively:

```bash
python src/explore_dataset_movies.py
python src/explore_dataset_ratings.py
```

[2] & [3] Both are provided through API endpoints, see below.

[4] See `Results` section

## Requirements

This project is developed using `python 3.7`.

### Advises

For a better experience, please make sure:

- the right version of `python` is installed
- `pip` is installed
- a `virtualenv` is configured

### Installation

Install dependencies in the root directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> NB: Installing the package `scikit-surprise` on `Windows` might require external dependencies, such as Visual Studio C++.

## API setup

The recommendation model is based on a trained model which takes approx. 20 minutes to train. Thus, this is not reasonable to run this task everytime
we restart the server.

For addressing this issue, the model is generated upfront, as follows:

```bash
python src/generate_prediction_model.py
```

The model should be saved to disk at this location:

```bash
data/model/model_20M.pkl
```

> NB: Its size is approx. 875 MB.

Once it is generated, both the `Flask` server and the API can be started using the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

> NB: This may take few minutes (~4-5 min.) since the saved model is loaded into memory at this stage, depending on your configuration.

## API documentation

The API skeleton is the following:

```bash
http://localhost:5000/api/<API_V>/<ENDPOINT>
```

with

```bash
<API_V>     API version
<ENDPOINT>  One of the following endpoints (without the starting '/')
```

The current API version is: `<API_V> = v1`

### Endpoints

1. GET */users/<USER_ID>*
2. GET */users/<USER_ID>/suggested_movies*
3. GET */movies/<MOVIE_ID>*
4. GET */movies/<MOVIE_ID>/most_similar_movies*

### */users/<USER_ID>*

Get all movies the specified user has rated in the dataset.

e.g.
```bash
GET api/v1/users/96
```

```json
{
    "id": 96,
    "movies": [
        {
            "movieId": 541,
            "rating": 5,
            "tags": [],
            "title": "Blade Runner (1982)",
            "genres": [
                "Action",
                "Sci-Fi",

            ]
        },
        {

        },

### Machine specifications

    - MacBook Air 13"
    - 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
    - 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7

### Future development/Improvements

- Most Similar Movies: Use other features than only movie genres
    - tags
    - scrape webpages to get additional info (director, casting, etc)
    - try different clustering techniques
    - get extra tags from content itself (poster, etc)
- Recommended movies:
    - try [neural networks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/Deep_Learning_Model.ipynb)
    - get more information about the users
    - use timestamp
    - use genome tags
- API
    - handle errors better (proper errors, logs, etc)
    - monitor VM performance
    - secure the API with [JWT](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-JWT/)
- Use a database instead of CSV files
- Build an Web interface
